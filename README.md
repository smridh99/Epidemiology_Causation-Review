# Epidemiology_Causation-Review


The aim of my research paper is to bridge a link between the high levels of UV radiations and the risk of cutaneous malignant melanoma in tropical regions of the Australian subcontinent.

A case-control study design has been chosen to determine if exposure i.e. ultraviolet radiations of the sun is associated with disease i.e. prevalence of melanoma, a type of skin cancer.

Targeting Individuals aged between 18-39 years, residing in the province of Queensland in Australia.


Conducted estimates using cross-tables and deduced interpretation.
